# Documentation Index for Metrics Pipeline Edge Cases

## Created Files

### 1. **EDGE_CASES_AND_EXPECTED_OUTPUTS.md**
**Purpose**: Comprehensive documentation of all edge cases and expected outputs  
**Content**: Detailed analysis of 14 categories of edge cases including:
- SQL syntax and structure issues
- Data access and permissions problems
- Data validation failures
- Network and connectivity issues
- Configuration problems
- Write operation failures
- And more...

### 2. **EDGE_CASES_QUICK_REFERENCE.md**
**Purpose**: Quick reference guide for common edge cases  
**Content**: 
- Summarized table of edge cases with expected logs and recon records
- Pipeline success scenarios
- Monitoring commands
- Troubleshooting steps
- Performance considerations

### 3. **EDGE_CASES_SUMMARY.md**
**Purpose**: Concise summary of key edge cases and expected behavior  
**Content**:
- Key edge case categories
- Expected code outputs for different scenarios
- Recon record states
- Common error messages
- Resilient processing behavior
- Monitoring and troubleshooting guidance

## How to Use These Files

### For Development and Testing
- Use **EDGE_CASES_AND_EXPECTED_OUTPUTS.md** for comprehensive understanding
- Reference **EDGE_CASES_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** for quick lookups during development
- Use **EDGE_CASES_SUMMARY.md** for overview and training

### For Production Monitoring
- Use monitoring commands from **EDGE_CASES_QUICK_REFERENCE.md**
- Reference BigQuery queries from **EDGE_CASES_SUMMARY.md**
- Follow troubleshooting steps from any of the documents

### For Issue Resolution
- Check **EDGE_CASES_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** table for quick diagnosis
- Use **EDGE_CASES_SUMMARY.md** for common error patterns
- Refer to **EDGE_CASES_AND_EXPECTED_OUTPUTS.md** for detailed analysis

## Key Insights from Edge Case Analysis

### Most Common Failures
1. **SQL execution errors** (syntax, permissions, missing tables)
2. **Configuration issues** (invalid JSON, missing dependencies)
3. **Data validation failures** (invalid denominators, missing required fields)
4. **Write operation failures** (target table issues, schema mismatches)

### Resilient Processing Benefits
- Pipeline continues even when individual metrics fail
- Partial successes are captured and recorded
- Comprehensive recon records for all metrics
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Production-ready error handling

### Expected Behavior Summary
- **Individual failures**: Logged as errors, marked as failed in recon, pipeline continues
- **Configuration failures**: Pipeline stops before processing
- **Write failures**: Marked as failed in recon, other tables continue processing
- **Partial success**: Pipeline completes successfully with mixed results

## Monitoring Strategy

### Key Metrics to Track
- Overall failure rate
- Per-metric failure patterns
- Target table write success rates
- Recon record success distribution

### Alert Configuration
- Critical: >50% failure rate
- Warning: >20% failure rate
- Info: Consistent individual metric failures

### Regular Checks
- Daily failure rate review
- Weekly recon record analysis
- Monthly performance optimization review

These documents provide comprehensive coverage of edge cases and expected outputs for your metrics pipeline with resilient processing capabilities.
