Query Optimizer Race,31,What is 'transitive closure' in optimization?,Closing the database connection after query,Converting outer joins to inner joins,Recursively joining a table to itself,If A=B and B=C; the optimizer infers A=C to apply filters to table C directly,D,Hard
Query Optimizer Race,32,What differentiates a 'Clustered' index from a 'Non-Clustered' index physically?,Clustered index is always smaller,Clustered index leaf nodes contain the actual data pages; Non-Clustered leaf nodes contain pointers,Clustered index is sorted by hash; Non-Clustered by value,There is no physical difference,B,Hard
Query Optimizer Race,33,Why might a 'UNION' be slower than a 'UNION ALL'?,UNION is deprecated,UNION performs a distinct sort/deduplication step,UNION ALL writes to disk; UNION uses RAM,UNION locks the tables,B,Hard
Query Optimizer Race,34,What is the 'N+1 Select Problem'?,A database limit on the number of columns,A syntax error in SELECT statements,An application antipattern where a query is executed once for the parent and then N times for N children,An optimizer bug adding 1 to all counts,C,Hard
Query Optimizer Race,35,In a Distributed Database (Sharded); what is 'Scatter-Gather'?,Broadcasting a query to all shards and aggregating results; which is often inefficient,Moving data to a single node before querying,Randomly selecting a node to query,Replicating data to all nodes,A,Hard
Query Optimizer Race,36,What is the primary role of the 'Algebrizer' (or Binder) step before optimization?,Resolving object names and data types to validate semantics,Creating the execution plan,Executing the query,Writing logs to disk,A,Hard
Query Optimizer Race,37,Which operator is typically used for `DISTINCT` operations in an execution plan?,Nested Loops,Compute Scalar,Sort or Hash Match (Aggregate),Table Spool,C,Hard
Query Optimizer Race,38,What is a 'Residual Predicate'?,A filter that cannot be applied during the index seek and must be checked against the rows after retrieval,A predicate that remains after the query finishes,A filter used in the HAVING clause,A predicate on a deleted row,A,Hard
Query Optimizer Race,39,Why is `SELECT * FROM View` sometimes dangerous for performance?,It causes a view lock,It may instantiate the underlying view logic (joins/aggregates) entirely even if you only need one column,It deletes the view definition,It forces a recompile,B,Hard
Query Optimizer Race,40,What is 'Row Goal' optimization?,The goal to minimize row size,The goal to store rows in column format,The goal to delete rows faster,The optimizer selects a plan designed to return the first N rows quickly (e.g. for TOP/LIMIT) rather than the total set,D,Hard
Query Optimizer Race,41,When would an optimizer prefer a 'Hash Join' over a 'Merge Join'?,When the inputs are already sorted,When the inputs are extremely small,When memory is very low,When the input tables are not sorted and indices are missing,D,Hard
Query Optimizer Race,42,What is the downside of 'Page Splitting' in an index?,It fragments the index and increases I/O for future scans,It deletes data,It changes the data types,It compresses the page too much,A,Hard
Query Optimizer Race,43,What is 'Soft Parsing' in Oracle (or Plan Cache hit in SQL Server)?,Reusing an existing execution plan for a parameterized query,Creating a new plan from scratch,Parsing the query without executing it,Checking syntax errors only,A,Hard
Query Optimizer Race,44,What does the 'Estimated Subtree Cost' represent?,The time in seconds the query will take,The amount of money the query costs in cloud credits,An arbitrary unitless number representing estimated resource consumption (CPU + I/O),The number of rows returned,C,Hard
Query Optimizer Race,45,Why is a 'Left Join' sometimes eliminated by the optimizer?,It is never eliminated,If the right table is empty,If the join condition is NULL,If the requested columns are only from the left table and the join doesn't duplicate rows (foreign key constraint exists),D,Hard
Query Optimizer Race,46,What is 'Update Statistics' doing?,Defragmenting the index,Recalculating the distribution of key values (histograms) to help the optimizer make better choices,Clearing the plan cache,Rolling back transactions,B,Hard
Query Optimizer Race,47,What is the risk of high 'Plan Cache Pollution'?,Too many indexes being created,The database log file filling up,Ad-hoc queries filling memory with single-use plans; evicting useful compiled plans,Data being deleted,C,Hard
