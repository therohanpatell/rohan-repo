validate_json

The validate_json method processes the provided JSON data as follows:

It checks each record for the presence of required fields (metric_id, metric_name, metric_type, sql, dependency, partition_mode).
It ensures that none of the required fields are empty or contain only whitespace.
It checks for duplicate metric_id values across all records.
It validates that the partition_mode field contains only valid modes ('currently' or 'partition_info').
If all checks pass, it logs a success message and returns the validated JSON data.
For the given JSON data, all records pass the validation checks, and the method would output a success message and return the original data.

Real Example:

Record 1:

metric_id: "1008"
metric_name: "Headcount"
metric_type: "Count"
partition_mode: "currently"
Record 2:

metric_id: "1009"
metric_name: "Headcount"
metric_type: "Count"
partition_mode: "partition_info"
Record 3:

metric_id: "1010"
metric_name: "Headcount"
metric_type: "Percentage"
partition_mode: "currently"
Record 4:

metric_id: "1011"
metric_name: "Proportion of Permanent Employees"
metric_type: "Percentage"
partition_mode: "currently|partition_info"
Validation Process
Step 1: Check Required Fields
For each record, the method checks if all required fields (metric_id, metric_name, metric_type, sql, dependency, partition_mode) are present.

All records have all required fields.
Step 2: Check Non-empty Values
The method ensures that none of the required fields are empty or contain only whitespace.

All required fields in all records have non-empty values.
Step 3: Check for Duplicate metric_id
The method keeps track of metric_id values to ensure no duplicates.

metric_id values are: "1008", "1009", "1010", "1011"
No duplicates found.
Step 4: Validate partition_mode
The method checks that the partition_mode field contains only valid modes ('currently' or 'partition_info').

Record 1:

partition_mode: "currently" → Valid
Record 2:

partition_mode: "partition_info" → Valid
Record 3:

partition_mode: "currently" → Valid
Record 4:

partition_mode: "currently|partition_info" → Split into ["currently", "partition_info"] → Both valid
Step 5: Log Validation Success
After validating all records, the method logs a success message.
