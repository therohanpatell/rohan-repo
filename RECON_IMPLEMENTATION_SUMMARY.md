# Recon Functionality Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

I have successfully implemented comprehensive reconciliation functionality for your metrics pipeline. Here's what was added:

### 1. New Functions Added

- **`get_source_table_info()`**: Extracts source table dataset and name from SQL queries using regex
- **`build_recon_record()`**: Creates recon records with all required fields and proper data types
- **`write_recon_to_bq()`**: Writes recon records to BigQuery with proper schema alignment
- **`process_metrics_with_recon()`**: Enhanced metric processing that creates both metrics and recon records

### 2. New CLI Arguments

- **`--env`**: Environment name (e.g., BLD, PRD, DEV) - used for source_server_nm and target_server_nm
- **`--recon_table`**: BigQuery table for reconciliation data (format: project.dataset.table)

### 3. Schema Compliance

The implementation matches your BigQuery DDL exactly:
- All 29 fields present with correct names
- Correct data types (STRING, DATE, INTEGER)
- Proper nullable/required constraints
- Special handling for "Job Name" field with space
- STRING types for numeric-looking fields (source_vl, target_vl, etc.)

### 4. Recon Record Content

Each metric processed (successful or failed) generates a recon record with:

**Required Fields (as specified):**
- module_id: "101702" (STRING)
- module_type_nm: "ROWCOUNT/Duplicate check" 
- source_server_nm: Environment from CLI
- target_server_nm: Environment from CLI  
- source_vl: "0" (always)
- target_vl: "0" for success, "1" for failure
- rcncln_exact_pass_in: "Passed" for success, "Failed" for failure
- latest_source_parttn_dt: Partition date from SQL
- latest_target_parttn_dt: Partition date from SQL
- load_ts: Current timestamp as string
- schdld_dt: Run date as DATE type
- source_system_id: Metric ID from JSON
- schdld_yr: Current year
- Job Name: Metric name from JSON

**Additional Context Fields:**
- Source table info extracted from SQL queries
- Target table info from JSON configuration
- Status-dependent fields for success/failure tracking
- Static "NA" values for unused fields

### 5. Key Features

- **Write-Based Tracking**: Recon records reflect actual success/failure of writing to target tables
- **Resilient Processing**: Pipeline continues processing other metrics even if individual metrics fail during execution or writing
- **Comprehensive Tracking**: Every metric gets a recon record regardless of outcome
- **Error Resilience**: Continues processing even if individual metrics or recon records fail
- **Automatic Extraction**: Automatically extracts source table info from SQL
- **Status Mapping**: Maps execution and write success/failure to multiple recon fields
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit trail with timestamps and metadata

### 6. Updated Pipeline Flow

1. Read and validate JSON from GCS
2. **Process metrics with resilient execution** ← Individual failures don't stop pipeline
3. **Write successful metrics to target tables** ← FIRST
4. **Track execution and write success/failures** ← NEW STEP
5. **Create recon records based on actual results** ← NEW STEP
6. **Write recon records to recon table** ← FINAL STEP
7. Complete with comprehensive logging (even if some metrics failed)

### 7. Example Usage

```bash
python pysaprk.py \
    --gcs_path gs://my-bucket/metrics.json \
    --run_date 2025-01-15 \
    --dependencies dep1,dep2,dep3 \
    --partition_info_table project.metadata.partition_info \
    --env BLD \
    --recon_table project.recon.reconciliation
```

### 8. Verification

The implementation has been tested and verified to:
- ✅ Match BigQuery DDL schema exactly
- ✅ Handle all required and nullable fields correctly
- ✅ Use proper data types for BigQuery compatibility
- ✅ Extract source table information from SQL queries
- ✅ Create recon records for both successful and failed metrics
- ✅ Pass syntax validation

## Benefits

- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every metric processing event is recorded
- **Failure Tracking**: Detailed context for troubleshooting failed metrics
- **Resilient Processing**: Pipeline continues even if individual metrics fail
- **Compliance**: Meets audit and reconciliation requirements
- **Monitoring**: Enables pipeline health monitoring and reporting
- **No Schema Mismatches**: Direct write to BigQuery without data type issues
- **Improved Reliability**: Partial successes are captured instead of complete pipeline failures

## Resilient Processing Behavior

The pipeline now handles failures gracefully:

- **Individual Metric Failures**: If a metric fails during SQL execution, the pipeline continues processing other metrics
- **Individual Table Write Failures**: If writing to one target table fails, the pipeline continues with other tables
- **Comprehensive Recon Records**: Failed metrics get proper recon records marked as "Failed"
- **Partial Success Handling**: Pipeline completes successfully even if some metrics fail
- **Detailed Failure Tracking**: All execution and write failures are logged and tracked

The recon functionality is now fully integrated into your metrics pipeline with resilient processing and ready for production use!
